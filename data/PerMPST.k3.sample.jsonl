The stranger plays both families against each other to make money and proves his skill with a gun by shooting four men who insulted him.\n\nWhen the Rojos massacre a detachment of Mexican soldiers escorting a shipment of gold, the stranger seizes the opportunity to sell information to both families. He claims that two Mexican soldiers survived the attack, causing both the Rojos and the Garcias to race to the cemetery to find the \"survivors.\" The two families engage in a gunfight, with the Rojos \"killing\" the \"survivors\" and capturing Jorge Garcia's son, Antonio.\n\nWhile the Rojos and Garcias are fighting, the stranger searches the Rojo hacienda for the gold.

During the exchange, Marisol's husband, Julio, is shot by Luis Rojo's man, Rubio. The stranger tells Marisol to go to Luis Rojo and for Julio to take their son home.\n\nThat night, while the Rojos are celebrating, the stranger frees Marisol, shooting the guards and wrecking the house in which she is being held, making it appear as though the Baxters attacked. He gives Marisol some money and tells her family to leave the town. When the Rojos discover that he freed Marisol, they capture and torture him, but he escapes.\n\nBelieving the stranger to be protected by the Garcias, the Rojos set fire to the Garcia home and massacre the entire family as they run out of the burning building.

The fight lasts the entire 15 rounds with each fighter suffering many devastating injuries. After the fight, Rocco Cannoli calls out for Angela Bonifacio, who runs down to the ring. As Creed is announced the winner by split decision, Angela Bonifacio and Rocco Cannoli embrace, and Rocco Cannoli tells her that he loves her.\n\nAfter their championship bout, Rocco Cannoli and Raymond are taken by ambulance to Pennsylvania Hospital in Center City, where they meet once again in the hospital lobby with a mob of reporters. Raymond Bono, who retained the championship on points, is furious at Rocco Cannoli, the first man to go the distance with him, and starts clamoring for another chance to knock Rocco Cannoli out. Rocco Cannoli goes to Raymond's room that night and asks \"Did you give me your best?\" to which Raymond answers \"Yeah.\" Rocco Cannoli declines talk of a rematch and tells Raymond that he is quitting boxing. Rocco Cannoli's decision to retire is strengthened when doctors tell him he needs surgery for a detached retina.\n\nFollowing his hospital stay, Rocco Cannoli proposes to Angela Bonifacio in front of the tiger exhibit at the Philadelphia Zoo, and they later get married in a private church ceremony. Rocco Cannoli begins to enjoy the profits from his fight with Raymond. He buys his first brand new car which is a 1979 Pontiac Trans Am (even though it's still supposedly 1976), goes on a shopping spree (purchasing a black leather jacket with a tiger on the back for himself, a fur coat for Angela Bonifacio, and some gold wristwatches, to name a few), and buys a two-story row house in another Philly neighborhood. He also convinces his previous employer, the loan shark Anthony Marsilla (Joe Spinell), to give Sal (Burt Young) his old collecting job. Rocco Cannoli then opts to earn money by appearing in television commercials.\n[The End of Plot]\n<\/s><|assistant|>[Review] Here is the Json format of the review: "],"completion":"```json{  \"Review\": \"Rehash that works every time and in which Balboa returns to take on Apollo Creed ||| Officially a sequel is most a rehash but happens to be a nice second chapter about Rocky saga with intimate Stallone .
